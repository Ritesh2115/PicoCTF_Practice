PROBLEM STATEMENT: How about some hide and seek heh? Look at this image here.
HINT 1:  Download the image and try to extract something hidden inside it.  

Now, if you’re using a Mac and don’t have steghide installed, no worries! You can use the webshell. But if you prefer installing it, use the following command:
sudo port install steghide
(Note: This process might take about 20 minutes.)  
 
Open your webshell and download the image using this command:
wget link_of_the_image
Once the image is downloaded (and steghide is set up on your Mac), run this command: steghide extract -sf /Downloads/atbash.jpg
When prompted for a passphrase, just press "Enter". Afterward, you’ll see a message like this:
wrote extracted data to "encrypted.txt".
Read the file named "encrypted.txt" and you'll get :  
krxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_1u84w779}

The name of the image itself gives away the cipher: Atbash Cipher.  

To decrypt it, I wrote the following Python code:  

def atbash_decrypt(ciphertext):
    decrypted_text = ""
    for char in ciphertext:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.isupper():
                decrypted_text += chr(65 + (25 - (ord(char) - 65)))
            elif char.islower():
                decrypted_text += chr(97 + (25 - (ord(char) - 97)))
        else:
            decrypted_text += char
    return decrypted_text

ciphertext = input("Enter the Atbash cipher text: ")
plaintext = atbash_decrypt(ciphertext)
print("Decrypted text:", plaintext)

After running this code and inputting the cipher text, I got :
picoCTF{atbash_crack_1f84d779}

Flag: picoCTF{atbash_crack_1f84d779}
