PROBLEM STATEMENT : How about some hide and seek heh? Look at this image here.

Since my MAC didn't have steghide installed I used the webshell.
First we need the download the image in the webshell using the following command
wget link_of_the_image
After
Spect0rVor7ex-picoctf@webshell:~$ steghide extract -sf atbash.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "encrypted.txt".
Spect0rVor7ex-picoctf@webshell:~$ cat encrypted.txt
