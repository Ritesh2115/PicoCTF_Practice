PROBLEM STATEMENT : We found a leak of a blackmarket website's login credentials. Can you find the password of the user cultiris and successfully decrypt it? Download the leak here. The
first user in usernames.txt corresponds to the first password in passwords.txt. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on.

HINT 1 : Maybe other passwords will have hints about the leak?

First I created a python program in the same directory as the usernames.txt and passwords.txt. The program :
with open('usernames.txt', 'r') as usernames_file:
    usernames = usernames_file.read().splitlines()
with open('passwords.txt', 'r') as passwords_file:
    passwords = passwords_file.read().splitlines()

try:
    index = usernames.index('cultiris')
    corresponding_password = passwords[index]
    print(f"The password corresponding to 'cultiris' is: {corresponding_password}")

The password found is : cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}

The password is ROT13 encrypted.

Flag : picoCTF{C7r1F_54V35_71M3}
