PROBLEM STATEMENT : A type of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher, which is described here(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher). Here is one such cipher encrypted
using the rail fence with 4 rails. Can you decrypt it? Download the message here. Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, picoCTF{decoded_message}.

HINT 1 : Once you've understood how the cipher works, it's best to draw it out yourself on paper

The message contains : Ta _7N6D49hlg:W3D_H3C31N__A97ef sHR053F38N43D7B i33___N6

As the question suggest the  message is a rail fence cipher. A rail fence cipher wants a key which is in the range {2, len(cipher)}.
So I created a python program to decode the cipher : 

def decrypt_rail_fence(ciphertext, key):
    rail = [['\n' for _ in range(len(ciphertext))] for _ in range(key)]

    direction_down = None
    row, col = 0, 0

    for _ in range(len(ciphertext)):
        if row == 0:
            direction_down = True
        if row == key - 1:
            direction_down = False
        rail[row][col] = '*'
        col += 1
        row += 1 if direction_down else -1

    index = 0
    for i in range(key):
        for j in range(len(ciphertext)):
            if rail[i][j] == '*' and index < len(ciphertext):
                rail[i][j] = ciphertext[index]
                index += 1

    result = []
    row, col = 0, 0
    for _ in range(len(ciphertext)):
        if row == 0:
            direction_down = True
        if row == key - 1:
            direction_down = False
        if rail[row][col] != '\n':
            result.append(rail[row][col])
            col += 1
        row += 1 if direction_down else -1

    return ''.join(result)

ciphertext = "Ta _7N6D49hlg:W3D_H3C31N__A97ef sHR053F38N43D7B i33___N6"
for key in range(2, len(ciphertext)):
    print(f"Key = {key}, Decrypted Text: {decrypt_rail_fence(ciphertext, key)}")

The output is for key = 4 : Decrypted Text: The flag is: WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_4A76B997

Flag : picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_4A76B997}
